# Fibonacci-number

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors omit the initial terms and start the sequence from 1 and 1 or from 1 and 2. Starting from 0 and 1, the next few values in the sequence are:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ... and so on.

I created a App where u can see what the next numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are. For the background i created a Shader using the ShaderGraph. And used the Universal Render Pipeline as Shader Asset.

Just press the button to acctivate the next number. Also the button has a basic sound effect.
